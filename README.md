# Black-List
Black List was an app that I developed when I was learning Swift 4.2 basics. It consists of an app where you can take notes of all the people that you hate. The user can also take a picture, edit the name, and delete people from the table.

Technologies Used:

  - UIKit
  - Core Data
  
  Here you can see also how to save data and retrieve them from Core Data xcdatamodel inside Swift.
